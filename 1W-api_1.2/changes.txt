Class      :  SHADebitUnsigned
Problem    :  EEPROM DS1961S device's memory could become corrupted
              if communication is interrupted, rendering the debit
              file useless.
Since      :  0.00
Description:  Since the DS1961S/DS2432 is a battery-less EEPROM
              device, sudden loss of power could cause an EEPROM bit
              to be half-written (i.e. on the borderline of being a
              1 or a 0) or the writing of the user's account data
              could become interrupted.
Solution   :  Two sectors of 8 bytes each are used to store the
              account data, while the actual TMEX file length
              indicates which sector holds the current amount.  If
              it is determined that there was an error in writing
              to the devious during a previous transaction, it is
              now possible to revert to the last known good value.

Problem    :  Each temperature device had it's own implementation
              of toFahrenheit() and toCelsius().
Since      :  0.00
Description:  Each of the temperature containers implemented it's
              own copy of toFahrenheit() and toCelsius(), and they
              weren't consistent.  Some used floats, others used

Problem    :  Need to distinguish between DS1921H/Z devices and other
              Thermochron models.
Since      :  0.00
Description:  No method exists to differentiate between the models of
              Thermochrons.  It can be done through parsing a special
              12-bit field of the part's 1-Wire Net Address.
Solution   :  Override OneWireContainer's setupContainer() method to

              call setThermochronVariables() method which parses a
              special 12-bit field of the Thermochron's 1-Wire net
              Address and sets the following variables:

              1)  partNumber:
                  DS1921L-F50 = physical range -40 to +85,
                                operating range -40 to +85.
                  DS1921L-F51 = physical range -40 to +85,
                                operating range -10 to +85.
                  DS1921L-F52 = physical range -40 to +85,
                                operating range -20 to +85.
                  DS1921L-F53 = physical range -40 to +85,
                                operating range -30 to +85.

                  DS1921H     = physical range 15 to 46,
                                operating range -40 to +85
                  DS1921Z     = physical range -5 to 26,
                                operating range -40 to +85
                  (All temps in degrees Celsius)
              2)  temperatureRangeLow - low temp. of temp. range
              3)  temperatureRangeWidth - temp. range width
              4)  temperaturResolution - temp resolution

              temperature resolution or the histogram bin width.
Since      :  1.00 Alpha
Description:  getDescription() returns a hard-coded string instead of
              a dynamically generated one.
Solution   :  Have getDescription() return a dynamically generated string
              made up of the above ranges, resolution, and bin width.
              Include new methods that get the operating range, the
              physical range, and resolution and the histogram bin width.
              The new methods are:
              getPhysicalRangeLowTemperature()

              updating for new DS1921H and DS1921Z Thermochrons.
Since      :  1.00 Alpha
Description:  The DS1921H and DS1921Z Thermochrons have different ranges
              and different temperature resolutions that affect how their
              temperatures are encoded and decoded.
Solution   :  Updated the encodeTemperature() and decodeTemperature() to
              reflect the new parts according to their respective
              datasheets.

Problem    :  No clear way to download the Histogram and Logs correctly
              with the new DS1921H and DS1921Z Thermochron's having
              different temperature ranges, different histogram bin widths,
              and different temperature resolutions.  Also, the
              starting temperature for the first histogram bin width is
              different (1 bin lower) for the H and Z than for other
              Thermochrons.
Since      :  1.00 Alpha
Description:  The DS1921H and DS1921Z Thermochrons are different in design
              as described above, making it necessary to create new methods
              to retrieve the histogram bin width, the temperature
              resolution, and the different starting temperatures of the
              first histogram bin before downloading the temperature
              histogram.
Solution   :  Created the following new methods:
              getTemperatureResolution() (also updated the other similar
                                          methods for the

Problem    :  OWFile utilities not J2ME-CLDC-compliant.
Since      :  1.00 Alpha
Description:  Since a lot of the I/O functionality (including File I/O) is
              missing from the J2ME CLDC, the OWFile utilities should not
              be dependent on the Java2 File I/O for functionality.
Solution   :  Implemented OWFileNotFoundException and OWSyncFailedException
              to replace missing classes.  Removed all other dependencies

Since      :  0.00
Description:  Near the end of recieving large amounts of
              data (>140 bytes) the button would not send
              data, causing us to report failure.
Solution   :  There appears to be a problem in the button
              where it reports that more data still needs
              to be read, but 0 bytes are available to read.
              This can be fixed by giving the button a
              little more time to read, so it can shuffle
              its buffers around to make data available.

Problem    :  Error in CopyScratchpad - uses strong pull-up twice
              without reset.
Since      :  1.00B
Description:  Strong pull-up was used for both calculating the mac and
              doing the eeprom write with copy scratchpad.  Because of
              an uncleared bit, an extra "TouchBit" is added to the
              routine for changing the power level.  As long as a reset
              is performed before the next strong pull-up, it will work
              normally, otherwise communication errors occur.
Solution   :  Removed strong pull-up from mac computation.  Mac
              computation should still proceed fine without it.

Problem    :  Switch to strong pull-up was done improperly.
Since      :  1.00B
Description:  Using the CONDITION_AFTER_BYTE flag for setting strong
              pull-up requires the use of the putByte command to set
              the level.  Instead of putByte, dataBlock was used with
              a length of 1 byte, which caused the level to not be
              set until the next time someone called putByte.
Solution   :  Changed dataBlock with length of 1 to putByte command.

              is setup, the sample rate is set to zero regardless
              of what is written to the device.
Solution   :  Clock needs time to start before clearing the memory.
              In clearMemory(), if the clock is not started it is
              first started and then a 751ms delay is added before

Class      :  OneWireContainer18
Problem    :  NullPointerException in setupContainer(adapter,byte[])
Since      :  0.00
Description:  Due to crazy chain of constructor calling super-
              constructor, which then called deferred method
              setupContainer which accesses a private variable that
              won't be initialized until super-constructor is
              finished.
Solution   :  Checked to see if the private variable,
              private_address, was initialized before using it.  If
              uninitialized, go ahead and initialize it.  Removed
              "declare and initialize" line and initialized it to
              null.

Package    :  com.dalsemi.onewire.container
Class      :  OneWireContainer18
Problem    :  Incorrect target address.
Since      :  0.00
Description:  In an effort to make super-fast data-page writes, an
              import step was skipped - reading the scratchpad to
              retrieve the target address.
Solution   :  Put back in retrieval of target address as well as a
              check to make sure that what was read from the
              scratchpad matches exactly what was written.

Package    :  com.dalsemi.onewire.container
Class      :  MemoryBankSHAEE
Problem    :  The method "needsPowerDelivery()" returned false.
Since      :  0.00
Description:  The SHA EE iButton (DS1961S) requires power delivery
              for EEPROM writes.
Solution   :  Changed needsPowerDelibery() to return true.
-=========================================================================-
Package    :  com.dalsemi.onewire.container
Class      :  MemoryBankSHAEE
Problem    :  The method "copyScratchpad()" does not provider power
              delivery.
Since      :  0.00
Description:  The SHA EE iButton (DS1961S) requires power delivery
              for EEPROM writes.
Solution   :  Modified the calls for data blocks to provide strong
              pullup after sending the last byte of the copy
              scratchpad command.
-=========================================================================-
Package    :  com.dalsemi.onewire.container
Class      :  MemoryBankSHAEE
Problem    :  The method "copyScratchpad()" computes the
              authorization MAC in software and does not allow for
              use of a hardware authorization coprocessor.
Since      :  0.00
Description:  If the secret was not known by the memory bank object,
              it would not be able to compute the necessary MAC.
              This is much less secure than having the MAC stored in
              a hardware coprocessor.
Solution   :  copyScratchpad was overloaded to allow for the MAC as
              a paramter:
              copyScratchpad(int addr, byte[] auth, int authStart)
-=========================================================================-
Package    :  com.dalsemi.onewire.container
Class      :  MemoryBankSHAEE
Problem    :  Inconsistent and confusing method names.
Since      :  0.00
Description:  Some of the names of the methods (as well as their
              paramaters) didn't match the methods of other memory
              banks.  Also, some methods that took in an "address"
              paramater would treat that as an absolute address and
              other methods as a relative address.
Solution   :  Methods were renamed for a consistent scheme across
              all memory banks and all address paramaters are
              treated as relative to the beginning of the memory
              bank.

Since      :  0.01
Description:  If an APDU fails, the part is unreachable by 1-Wire
              communication.

Class      :  OWFileOutputstream
Problem    :  Throws exception from constructor if file creation
              fails, but does not free cached resources.
Since      :  0.01
Description:  If the creation of a file fails in
              OWFileOutputStream's constructor, an exception is
              thrown causing the object not to be allocated.  Caller
              module is then not able to free the resources allocated
              by OWFileOutputStream in it's cache.
Solution   :  Added try-catch around creation method call.
              Resources are then freed automatically and exception
              is re-thrown.

Class      :  USerialAdpater
Problem    :  Method putByte does not check the echo of each byte
              written to the 1-Wire net.
Since      :  0.00
Description:  For early early detection of 1-Wire errors, it is
              important that each byte is checked for the
              appropriate echo.
Solution   :  Added check to see if what was written matches exactly
              what was read.
