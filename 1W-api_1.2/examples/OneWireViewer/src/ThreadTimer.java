/**
 * An extension of Thread designed to fire events with a certain delay in
 * between each thread.  The only gaurantee this class makes is that the
 * time between firing an action event will be <u>at least</u> as long as
 * the delay specified.  The ThreadTimer also has a minimum resolution of
 * 100 milliseconds.  Meaning, no delay less than 100 ms is possible and
 * all delays should be multiples of 100 ms.  If you specify a delay of
 * 150 ms, at least 200 ms will pass before ThreadTimer fires an event.
