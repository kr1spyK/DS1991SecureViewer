| 1-Wire Switch Demo (ReadSwitch) |
-----------------------------------

I. Description
=------------=
Find and read all 1-Wire devices that implement 
the SwitchContainer interface.

II. Files
=------=
readme.txt             - this file
run.bat                - batch file to run this example
build.bat              - batch file to rebuild this example
tini_build.bat         - batch file to rebuild this example for TINI
ReadSwitch.class       - prebuilt Desktop class
\src\ReadSwitch.java   - source for this example
\tini\ReadSwitch.tini  - prebuilt TINI class (for TINI 1.02 or later)

III. Instructions
=--------------=

Desktop: 

1. Use the provided 'run.bat' to start this application.
   It will automatically search for a Switch on the Default 1-Wire 
   port. A 1-Wire Adapter/Port can be specified on the command line
   with the following syntax.

       Usage: 
          java ReadSwitch ADAPTER_PORT
            ADAPTER_PORT is a String that contains the name of the
            adapter you would like to use and the port you would like
            to use, for example: 
                   java ReadSwitch {DS1410E}_LPT1

2. Use the 'build.bat' to rebuild this example.  Note that this batch
   file assumes it is in the specific example directory.  It is recommended
   for ease of use to put the OneWireAPI.jar file in your default classpath
   or in <JDK_HOME>\jre\lib\ext.

TINI (1.02 or later):

1. Load ReadSwitch from the examples\ReadSwitch\tini directory
   using FTP. First open FTP and execute the following commands (for the sake
   of this discussion assume you chose 180.0.42.43 for your IP address):

       open 180.0.42.43
       root
       tini
       bin
       put ReadSwitch.tini
       close
       quit

  In Windows 9x you can place these commands in a script file (e.g. doftp.cmd) 
  and execute with 'ftp -s:doftp.cmd'.

2. Open a Telnet session to your TINI board.

    Welcome to slush.  (Version 1.02)

    TINI login: root
    TINI password:
    TINI />   

3. To get command line systax execute ReadSwitch without any parameter
   'java ReadSwitch.tini'.  Parameters can be added as described above
   under Desktop.

4. Use the 'tini_build.bat' to rebuild this example for TINI.  Note that this 
   batch file assumes it is in the specific example directory.  This batch 
   file uses the  environment variable TINI_HOME.  This variable must be set 
   before running build batch file. For example:  
       set TINI_HOME=e:\tini1.02

   'tini_build.bat' compiles in all known types of Switches.  The end
   result .tini file can be reduced in size if only the 1-Wire Containers
   needed are included.
